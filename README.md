# Sea Scope
Fisheries Visual Data Management and Peak Classification Accuracy

The goal of the Sea Scope project is to offer insights into fishery data, particularly by visualizing species data and forecasting fish species based on specified indicators. Fish.csv is the primary dataset utilized.

This project uses machine learning to classify fish species based on their visual features. 

# The project is divided into the following tasks:
Bringing the dataset in.
determining the Height column's maximum value.
locating the Pike species fish with the biggest weight.
removing the empty columns.
Species column numeric data conversion.
displaying the statistics for the species of bream.
constructing a logistic regression model for fish species classification.

# These Python libraries were used to accomplish the project:
pandas
sklearn
matplotlib

# The project can be run by following these steps:
Clone the repository.
Install the dependencies.
Run the sea_scope.ipynb notebook.
The project achieves a test set accuracy of 81.25%.
